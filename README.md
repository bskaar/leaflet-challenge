In the Repository, I have saved several PNG of the following:

1. Leaflet map coordinates rendered from the data: Leaflet_map_coordinates rendered correctly.png

2. Completed Leaflet map with earthquake coordinates represented as a bubble: Completed Leaflet map showing earthquake activity.png

3. Zoomed in view of a specific earthquake point: Zoom in of earthquake data point.png
